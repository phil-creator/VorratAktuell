In our analysis, we observed that the dependent variable Vol, representing wood volume, exhibits a right-skewed distribution.
This means that while the majority of data points cluster around lower values, a small number of observations lie far out on 
the right tail of the distribution â€” these are unusually high volume values that occur rarely in the forest, but are valid 
and plausible.

Skewed data, particularly when it's right-skewed, can introduce several problems in modeling. Most statistical and machine
learning models assume some level of symmetry or normality in the response variable. Right-skewed data can disproportionately 
influence estimates like the mean, distort residuals, and lead to biased model predictions. Especially when outliers are extreme, 
the model might overfit or give undue weight to these rare cases, at the expense of overall accuracy and generalization.

To address this issue, we explored several transformation techniques aimed at reducing skewness and improving distributional symmetry:

    Log transformation: This commonly used approach for right-skewed data overcorrected in our case. The transformation made the distribution
strongly left-skewed, and this led to worse results in terms of model fit and interpretability.

    Box-Cox transformation: This method was also tested, but it had the undesirable effect of collapsing most data values to a single constant.
As a result, it significantly distorted the variable's structure and failed to preserve meaningful variation.

    Scaling (standardization): Simply centering the data and scaling it to unit variance did not address the skewness problem. While it
normalized the scale, it did nothing to mitigate the influence of extreme outliers.

    Square root transformation: This method turned out to be the most effective. It reduced the skewness to nearly zero (approx. -0.17),
while preserving the general distribution and interpretability of the data. Importantly, it dampened the effect of outliers without excessively 
compressing the rest of the values.

To evaluate the impact of these transformations visually, we created histograms of the original, scaled, and square root-transformed data.
Each was color-coded by relative distance from the median to emphasize distribution symmetry and outlier influence. Among the approaches tested,
the square root transformation achieved the best balance between visual clarity, statistical normality, and practical modeling performance.

In conclusion, while the original right-skewed distribution of Vol is understandable given the ecological nature of the data, it poses challenges
for modeling. Through systematic testing, we found that a square root transformation offers a simple yet effective solution, improving both the
statistical properties of the variable and its suitability for predictive modeling. For now, we recommend using sqrt(Vol) as the transformed 
response variable. Predictor variables, in contrast, do not necessarily require transformation unless they too exhibit problematic skewness
or extreme scale differences.
