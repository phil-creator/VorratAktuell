As part of a statewide approach to individual tree detection, a method was developed based on
photogrammetrically derived normalized Digital Surface Models (nDSM) with a resolution of 1 meter.
The aim was not to identify every single tree with maximum accuracy, but rather to generate a 
statistically robust and spatially consistent estimation of tree distribution across the entire
state of Baden-Württemberg. These data serve as the basis for deriving a stand density raster at
a 10×10 meter resolution. The detected individual trees act as a proxy for local stand density
rather than as an exact tree count.

Tree detection is performed automatically using a local maxima filter (LMF), a common technique
in remote sensing for canopy detection. The key aspect of this methodology is the definition of
a dynamic search window size that varies depending on the height value of the nDSM pixels. Higher
nDSM values indicate taller trees, which generally correspond to larger canopy diameters. Therefore,
the size of the search window, within which local maxima are identified as potential tree tops,
is variable. For very small trees (under 2 meters), a minimum window size of 3 meters is used to 
avoid misinterpretation of ground noise or smaller vegetation structures. For tree heights around
20 meters and above, the window size is capped at 5 meters to prevent over-segmentation of very 
large crowns. Between these thresholds, the window size grows asymptotically with tree height, 
establishing a realistic relationship between tree height and canopy diameter.

This adaptive approach takes into account the natural variability of tree sizes in the field and
enables robust detection of individual trees even in heterogeneous stands. At the same time, it
avoids excessive computational effort that would result from using very large or very small fixed
windows across a uniform raster. By averaging detected trees over a 10×10 meter raster, the effects 
of potential over- or under-detection of individual trees are largely balanced out. The focus is not
on the absolute number of correctly identified trees, but on the consistent mapping of spatial differences
in tree density. Thus, the method aims to capture patterns and distributions rather than conducting a
full individual tree inventory.

Overall, this approach offers a scalable, comprehensive, and statistically reliable way to utilize 
photogrammetric height information for forestry planning and analysis purposes. The generated tree density
information can be used as input variables in volume estimation models or as predictors in spatial analyses.
The methodological standardization and automation across the entire state also enable reproducible and 
comparable data sets over different time periods and regions.
